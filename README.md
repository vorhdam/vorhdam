# Hello there, I'm Ádám!

I'm a 18-year-old developer from Budapest, Hungary developing web tools and projects including my startup attempt: [@nordaun](https://github.com/nordaun)

## What about now:

- My 5 year programming journey has come to a temporary halt.
- To put it simply I am currently busy learning for a sort of entry exam for universities in Hungary called "Érettségi". After I graduate high school and do my exams, I will be back on the grind.
- When I have some free time i am learning to code (mostly Python for algorithms) or trying to progress with my startup.

## Current projects:

### [Nordaun](https://github.com/nordaun)

**Nordaun** is my first startup idea turned project that represents my skills. It will showcase every skill mentioned above however it looks like it will be a long-running project if i wanna finish it.
